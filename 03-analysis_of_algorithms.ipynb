    "# Analysis of algorithms\n",
    "Often we have more than one way to solve a problem. Each one of these ways is called **an algorithm** which is simply a precise set of instructions to solve a problem. How do we then compare between two algorithms solving the same problem and determine which one is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answering this question is at the core of what analysis of algorithms is.  To start, let's identify the attributes or quantities that we can measure and use to describe algorithms. There are many quantities to list including but not limited to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* the programming language used\n",
    "* how many lines of code\n",
    "* the time it takes to run the algorithm\n",
    "* the space (in memory) it requires to run \n",
    "\n",
    "Because algorithms are language-agnostic, we consider only the time and space. There is also the size of the input the algorithm runs on that needs also to be considered. This is because efficient algorithms (in terms of time and/or space) running on small input might not be so efficient when running on large input.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, we analyze an algorithm by considering its time and space as functions of its input size. Such analysis is important for many reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To have a way of predicting the performance of an algorithm \n",
    "* To compare two or more algorithms\n",
    "* To provide guarantees that a particular algorithm will not exceed a certain bound \n",
    "* To avoid performance problems\n",
    "\n",
    "But measuring time is not as easy as it may sounds at first. This is because the actual time an algorithm takes to run deffer from one machine to another, and from one compiler to another, and from one operating system to another. We need to abstract all these differences away and be able to **use time without actually measuring time**. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we use a **theoretical (computer) model** where every single operation takes the same unit of time to run and where the overall time of an algorithm is calculated by counting how many operations are performed based on the given input. The number of operations performed by the algorithm would then be the same on any computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words,  using this model reduces measuring the time an algorithm takes to run to counting the number of operations performed by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "It also turns out that we only need to approximate the operation counts and not be exact. Such approximation gives us the ability to study the time and/or space behavior of an algorithm as a function of its input without getting bogged down with the details of exact counting. And the key to this approximation is the fact that in algorithms certain operations are dominant. For example, in an algorithm that adds numbers, addition is the dominating operation, which in a search algorithm, comparison is the dominating operation. Similarly, in a matrix multiplication algorithm which involves addition and multiplication, multiplication is the dominating operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing algorithms, we only need to identify the dominating operations and count them; the other operations can be ignored. \n",
