    "# Binary search trees\n",
    "A binary search tree (or BST for short) is a data structure that organizes data into a tree-like structure. Such a structure provides an efficient way not only for inserting elements into a tree, but also for searching them or deleting them. In other words, a BST achieves all the benefits of a linked list with a few extra benefits. It makes it possible to search data in $O(log(n))$ time which was only possible with binary search for arrays, not linked lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the data elements that are stored in a BST are unique; **no two elements are have the same value**. Think about a dictionary; you only want to have a single entry per word.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a BST, every data element is a node. Being binary means that a node can have at most two children. If a node does not have children, it's called a **leaf**. Let's see an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "          6\n",
    "       /    \\\n",
    "     /        \\\n",
    "    3          8\n",
    "  /   \\      /   \\\n",
    " /     \\    /     \\\n",
    "1       4  7       9\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tree, we call the element at the top (6) the **root**. It has two children: **left** and **right**. The left child of 6 is 3 and the right child of 6 is 8. Similarly, node 3 has two children: 1 (left) and 4(right). The same goes for node 8 with its children 7(left) and 9(right). The nodes 1, 4, 7, and 9 are leaves; they have no children. All nodes, except for the **root**, have a parent. For example, node 8 is the parent of both 7 and 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a binary search tree (BST) means having the following property: **every node is greater than all the nodes to its left and is less than all the nodes to its right.**. We call this the **binary search property** and it must be maintained for every node in the BST. For example, node 6 is greater that all the nodes to its left (3, 1, and 4) and is less than all the nodes to its right (8, 7, and 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this property, the order in which elements are inserted into the BST controls the shape of the tree. Say for example we have the following data and and we enter them into the BST in the order from left to right.\n",
    "```\n",
    "12, 8, 16, 2, 17, 3, 9, 1\n",

    "```\n",

    "# AVL Trees\n",
    "An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that guarantees the height of the tree is approximately $log(n)$. The AVL tree attaches a height value to every node. The height of a node $x$ is the maximum number of nodes on the path from that node ($x$) to a leaf, including $x$ itself. And the height of the tree is the height of its root node. For example, here is an AVL tree, which as you see is a fairly balanced BST. \n",
