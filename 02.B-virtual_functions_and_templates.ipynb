    "# Virtual Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to encapsulation and inheritance, **polymorphism** is the third principle of object-oriented programming. It means multiple forms. and it is supported by C++ at both compile-time and run-time. At compile-time, we can think of function overloading and operator overloading as forms of polymorphism, where the same function name or operator is used to mean and do different things in different contexts. At run-time polymorphism is achieved by combining inheritance and **virtual functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking **virtual** means existing in appearance but not in reality. In c++, a **virtual function** is a member function declared at the base class and redefined (or overridden) by a derived class. When this happens, the derived class will have access to two functions with the same name and signature: one provided by the base class and the other by the derived class itself. When a **virtual function** is called, the compiler defers deciding on which function definition to use until run-time. We call this **late binding** which is different from the **early binding** utilized by non-virtual functions.\n",
    "\n",
