We will cover six sorting algorithms all of which are comparison-based. These algorithms are **bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort**, and **heap sort**. The first three algorithms (bubble, selection, and insertion) are often described as elementary, the last three algorithms (merge, quick, and heap) are considered fast.\n",
